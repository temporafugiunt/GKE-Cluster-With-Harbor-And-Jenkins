This example is the starting point for th post: [Build A Secure CRUD App with ASP.NET Core and React](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/02/build-a-secure-crud-app-with-aspnetcore-and-react).

**Prerequisites**:
Make sure you have the .NET Framework 2.0, Node 8 or better, and NPM installed.

## Getting Started

You can start with a basic application that has .NET serving up a React app, and the API for that React app by cloning the following repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-dotnetcore-react-example.git 
cd okta-dotnetcore-react-example
npm install
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You should see something similar to this:
